% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.0 May 2012
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement

%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'

%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of

% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the

\begin{abstract}
	

This work presents EvoSpace-Interactive, an open source framework for the development of collaborative-interactive evolutionary algorithms for art and design. The main components of the framework are i) Evospace, a population store for the development of
cloud-based evolutionary algorithms, implemented using Redis key-value server and ii) Interactive, a Django framework   application where end-users collaborate in a social network sharing, collecting, rating and ultimately evolving individuals. Individuals are presented as multimedia elements (images, animations, sound) using the Processing programming language.    Details of the design are presented and two example applications are shown to illustrate the potential of the tool.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Architecture}

\section{EvoSpace}

EvoSpace consists of two main components (see figure~\ref{fig:evo}): (i) the EvoSpace container
that stores the evolving population and (ii) remote clients called EvoWorkers, which execute the actual evolutionary process, while EvoSpace acts only as a population repository.
In a basic configuration, EvoWorkers extract a small subset of the population, and use it as the initial population for a local EA executed on the client machine. Afterwards, the evolved population from each EvoWorker is returned to the EvoSpace container. A server-side ReInsertionManager process is used to alleviate possible problems that might occur during the search;
for instance, when the EvoSpace container starves or connections are lost. This can be done because a copy of each sample is stored in a priority queue used by ReInsertionManager to re-insert the sample to the central population;
similar to games where characters are respawned after a certain time. In the experiments conducted in this work the ReInsertionManager is not activated, as EvoWorkers are being executed in a server platform where lost connections are rare. Figure~\ref{fig:evo} illustrates the main components and dataflow within EvoSpace.

This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.

\section{Acknowledgments}
This section is optional; it is a location for you
to acknowledge grants, funding, editing assistance and
what have you.  In the present case, for example, the
authors would like to thank Gerald Murray of ACM for
his help in codifying this \textit{Author's Guide}
and the \textbf{.cls} and \textbf{.tex} files that it describes.

% The following two commands are all you need in the

% You must have a proper ".bib" file
